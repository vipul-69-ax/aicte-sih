AICTE is in constant efforts to improve the quality of technical education in India. We, at AICTE, are committed to promote holistic, qualitative, inclusive and accessible education in the country with an aim to make India a technical hub by 2047. AICTE emphasizes social and emotional learning as a crucial component of Education in line with NEP 2020 and has introduced Universal Human Values as a mandatory portion in the model curriculum. The core strength to build a technically strong ecosystem in the country lies in the hands of our institutions and future generations, who have a bigger role to play in the nation building and development of the country. Technical education is a pillar in the educational ecosystem, geared towards imparting technical learning and skills in various fields, from engineering and IT to healthcare and vocational trades. Considering the same, AICTE is endeavoring to build a transparent and hasslefree technical education ecosystem by ensuring seamless approvals to the institutions through AICTE Approval Process Handbook. As envisaged in the provisions laid down in National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the Nations proactive initiatives towards enhancement of GER, the Council decided to remove the upper limit on intake allowed earlier for the Courses / Programs offered by existing institutions. This is subject to the fulfillment of infrastructure availability, its readiness and filled faculty position. Before grant of approval to the increase in intake sought by the institution, the council shall ascertain the infrastructure and faculty availability through an EVC. The Approval Process Handbook of AICTE acts like a roadmap for all institutions seeking approval from the council to run programmes/courses falling under our ambit. In order to streamline the process, AICTE made rigorous efforts to make the new APH 2024-27 more concise, easy to understand and implement. To make this handbook more accessible, AICTE posted the draft of the handbook in the public domain to seek real feedback and get clear understanding of institutions requirements with AICTE. Based on the feedbacks/suggestions received from various stakeholders and on rigorous deliberations with experts drawn from academia and industry, the council proposed various amendments to the approval granting process, ensuring that the handbook has all the important information, transparent guidelines, minimum procedures and most importantly AICTE\u2019s reformative decisions. Here\u2019s the snippet of new changes introduced in the APH: 1. Provision for Extension of Approval up to 3 years for outstanding Institutions. 2. Simplified Regulation for Extension of Approval for the Institutions. 3. Provision for employed/ working professionals to upgrade their academic qualification /skill sets at diploma/degree/ postgraduate level through flexible mode (timings). i4. Undergraduate Programs/Courses in computer applications and management offered through General Degree Colleges (Non-Technical Institutions) have been brought under the umbrella of AICTE to ensure coordinated development in technical and management education. 5. Provision for existing Institutions to introduce undergraduate courses in computer application (BCA) and management (BBA/BMS). 6. Introduced Off-Campus provision for well performing existing institutions within the city. 7. Reduction in compliances related to requirement of land documents and NOC from affiliating University/ State/ UT Govt. 8. Provision of Hibernation for the Institutions looking for upgradation/revamping of the facilities. 9. Enabling provision for merger of Institutions under the Different T rust/ Society/ Company. 10. More clarity on the approval process for Open and Distance Learning (ODL)/Online Learning (OL) 11.

Huge emphasis on innovation through the INDOVATION program and by establishing Institution\u2019s Innovation Council (IIC) in their campuses. The Approval Process Handbook 2024-27 has been created with a progressive approach which enables institutions to function in the most efficient and effective manner. The role of AICTE in Technical Education is more like a facilitator than a regulator. From offering internships to job placements, faculty development programs to student exchange programs, integrating skills in higher education institutions to introducing courses in emerging areas, AICTE is committed to enhance entrepreneurship, employability, and skills development. AICTE shall continue to strive to be a true mentor, facilitator and enabler in bringing out the best in each Institution. I hope all the education partners/stakeholders of technical education shall add their value in making India Atma Nirbhar and a technical hub across the globe Prof. T. G. Sitharam Chairman, AICTE iiOur Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister has given us the target of making Bharat a developed country by 2047. To achieve this goal, our education sector must evolve to meet the changing needs of students in fast\u2013paced, digital world. Our educational institutions need to be dynamic, adaptive, emphasize innovation and relevant to global requirements. AICTE\u2019s new Approval Process Handbook 2024-25 to 2026-27 is definitely a step in this direction. As per AICTE\u2019s new handbook, a streamlined approval process has been created with less complexity fostering more transparency and faster decision making. For the very first time, the draft of Approval Process Handbook was put out in the public domain to seek feedback from diverse audience to encourage transparency and collaboration and some good suggestions were included in the final version of APH . Hon\u2019ble Chairman AICTE has already elaborated in detail major changes introduced in current APH. However, to reiterate a few, from this year more flexibility is given to Colleges to propose their student intake capacity, lesser document requirements for land and building, initiating approval process through a single window, etc. Also, as the demands of the job market evolves, so do the educational needs of Students. Hence, from this year AICTE decided to give approvals for Diploma/ BE/BTech/ME/MTech/MBA, etc. programmes for working professionals. This move is definitely going to give huge opportunity to working professionals to upgrade their skills and education simultaneously. Now every technical working professional will have an opportunity to pursue education without quitting job or taking long leave. More importantly, as we approach the dawn of a new era, it becomes increasingly imperative to realise the importance of technical education in shaping a better tomorrow. Through technical education, the country can continue to produce a steady stream of innovators and entrepreneurs who can drive technological progress and advance its standing in the global knowledge economy. New Approval Process Handbook 2024-2027 is step towards fulfilling our Education Goal of 2047 laid out by our P rime Minister. Message from Vice Chairman Desk Dr. Abhay Jere Vice Chairman, AICTE iii\u201cAll efforts have been made to simplify the system to a larger extent and a process has been developed which is transparent and trust based in line with the vision of the Government. Institution can avail approval for larger duration and flexibility has been given to become multidisciplinary institutions. As per provisions of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, provision for upgradation of qualification of Working Professionals has been introduced. More emphasis has been given on Skilling, Multiple Entry & Exit and integration of Vocational Education with main stream education. For internationalisation of technical education, twinning programme and collaborative programmes have been encouraged. Teachers, who are the central point of education, are being trained with a newer technologies through ATAL Academy and NEAT. Large number of internships are being provided to students through AICTE internship portal. With all such initiatives and policy reforms our students will not only perform nationally but also compete internationally.\u201d Message from Member Secretary Desk Prof. Rajive Kumar Member Secretary, AICTE ivApproval Process Handbook 2024-2027INDEX Sr. No.ParticularsPage No. 1 Foreword i 2 Abbreviations vi 3 Definitions viii 4 Preamble xii 5 Chapter-I Grant of Approval for New Institution 1 6 Chapter-II Grant of Extension of Approval for Existing Institutions 11 7 Chapter-III Collaboration & Twinning Programmes 33 8 Chapter-IV Grant of Approval for Universities 37 9 Chapter-V Approval for Open and Distance Learning (ODL) / Online Learning (OL) 45 10 Chapter-VI Standard Norms and Requirements 53 11 Chapter-VII Penal Action on Violation of Norms 70 12 Chapter-VIII DOS and DON\u2019TS75 13 Annexures77 14 Affidavits172 15 Formats & Certificates188 vApproval Process Handbook 2024-2027ABBREVIATIONS Abbreviations ACA Access and Circulation Area ADF AICTE Doctoral Fellowship AICTE All India Council for Technical Education AIU Association of Indian Universities APAAR Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry ATAL AICTE Training and Learning Academy ATMA Association of Indian Management Schools (AIMS) Test for Management Admission APH Approval Process Handbook ARIIA Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievements BCA Bachelor of Computer Application BBA Batchelor of Business Administration BBS Batchelor of Business Studies BMS Batchelor of Management Studies B.

Having subtracted the [highest possible] cube from the last ghana, the cube root [of that number] is placed seperately.[Next] one should divide the digit preceding that [ghana digit], by three times the square of this [root]. One should place the quotient [ thus obtained] on the pankti. One should subtract three times the product of that [quotient] and the antya (previous result on the answer line). from the digit preceding that [agana digit], and the cube of the quotient from the next [ganana position]. Thus, the pankti would be the cube root. Thereafter , repeat like this [on further digits].Approval Process Handbook 2024-202733 CHAPTER-III Collaboration & Twinning Programmes Student Exchange Programmes/Twinning Programmes, Joint Degree Programmes and Dual Degree Programmes between Indian and Foreign University/ Institution or between two Indian Institutions in the field of T echnical Education, Research and Training AICTE accords approval to Technical Institutions for conducting courses through collaborative/ twinning mode programs with reputed Universities/ Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in India/ Foreign Countries.
